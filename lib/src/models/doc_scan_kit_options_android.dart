/// Android-specific configuration options for the document scanner.
/// 
/// This class extends [DocScanKitOptions] to provide Android-specific settings
/// that control the behavior of Google's ML Kit Document Scanner API.
/// 
/// These options allow fine-tuning of the scanner experience on Android devices,
/// including page limits, scanner modes, and gallery import capabilities.
/// 
/// Example usage:
/// ```dart
/// final androidOptions = DocScanKitOptionsAndroid(
///   format: DocScanKitFormat.document,
///   pageLimit: 10,
///   scannerMode: ScannerModeAndroid.full,
///   isGalleryImport: true,
/// );
/// ```

  /// Creates Android-specific scanner options with the given configuration.
  /// 
  /// [format] - Output format for scanned documents (inherited from parent).
  /// [pageLimit] - Maximum number of pages that can be scanned in one session.
  /// [scannerMode] - Scanner mode determining available features and capabilities.
  /// [isGalleryImport] - Whether users can import images from the photo gallery.

  /// 
  /// This property limits how many document pages a user can capture before
  /// the scanner automatically completes the session. Setting a higher limit
  /// allows for multi-page document scanning.

  /// Valid range: 1 to 100 pages
  /// Default value: 1

  /// - [ScannerModeAndroid.base]: Basic editing capabilities (crop, rotate, reorder)
  /// - [ScannerModeAndroid.filter]: Adds image filters to base mode
  /// - [ScannerModeAndroid.full]: Adds ML-powered cleaning and future features
  /// 
  /// Default value: [ScannerModeAndroid.full]
  /// 
  /// Higher modes provide more features but may require more processing power
  /// and potentially longer processing times.

  /// 
  /// When enabled, the scanner interface will include an option for users to
  /// select existing photos from their gallery instead of only capturing new ones.
  /// This is useful for processing documents that were previously photographed.
  /// 
  /// Default value: true
