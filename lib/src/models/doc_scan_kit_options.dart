/// This class defines the common interface and shared properties for configuring
/// the document scanner behavior across different platforms. Platform-specific
/// implementations should extend this class and provide their own additional options.

/// The main shared property is [format], which determines whether the scanner
/// should return individual image files or a combined PDF document.

  /// This property controls how the scanner processes and returns scanned content:
  /// - [DocScanKitFormat.images]: Returns individual JPEG image files for each scanned page
  /// - [DocScanKitFormat.document]: Returns a single PDF file containing all scanned pages
  /// 
  /// The default value is [DocScanKitFormat.images].

  /// Platform-specific implementations must override this method to serialize
  /// their configuration options into a format that can be sent to native code
  /// through method channels.

  /// Returns a [Map<String, dynamic>] containing the serialized options.
